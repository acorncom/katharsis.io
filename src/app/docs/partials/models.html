<h2 class="text-center">Models</h2>
<div class="divider brand centered no-margin-top"></div>

<p>There are several annotations which can be assigned to models. By default all fields of the model are reflected in
	JSON API communication except synthetic fields. The annotations described below should be associated with either a
	field or a getter.</p>

<h4 class="padding-top-1x heading-dash">JsonApiResource</h4>
<p>It is the most important annotation which defines a resource. It requires type parameter to be defined that is used
	to form a URLs and type field in passed JSONs.
	According to JSON API standard, the name defined in type can be either <a
		href="http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure-resource-identification">plural or singular</a></p>
<p>The example below shows a sample class which contains a definition of a resource.</p>
<div hljs language="java" include="'assets/code/docs/jsonApiResource.java'"></div>

<h4 class="padding-top-1x heading-dash">JsonApiId</h4>
<p>Defines a field which will be used as an identifier of a resource. Each resource requires this annotation to be
	present on a field which type implements <code>Serializable</code> or is of primitive type.</p>
<p>The example below shows a sample class which contains a definition of a field which contains an identifier.</p>
<div hljs language="java" include="'assets/code/docs/jsonApiId.java'"></div>

<h4 class="padding-top-1x heading-dash">JsonApiToOne</h4>
<p>Indicates an association to single value which need to be handled by a separate <code>RelationshipRepository</code>.
	A type of the field has to be a valid resource.</p>
<p>The example below shows a sample class which contains this kind of relationship.</p>
<div hljs language="java" include="'assets/code/docs/jsonApiToOne.java'"></div>

<h4 class="padding-top-1x heading-dash">JsonApiToMany</h4>
<p>Indicates an association to many values which need to be handled by a separate <code>RelationshipRepository</code>.
	A type of the field has to be an <code>Iterable</code> or its derived classes (e.g.<code>List</code>) of valid
	resources.</p>
<p>The example below shows a sample class which contains this kind of relationship.</p>
<div hljs language="java" include="'assets/code/docs/jsonApiToMany.java'"></div>

<h4 class="padding-top-1x heading-dash">JsonApiIncludeByDefault</h4>
<p>Indicates additional resources that should be included by default (will be available in <i>included</i> field of Top
	level JSON object) with every primary resource. The field can be added to every relationship defined by
	<code>JsonApiToOne</code> or <code>JsonApiToMany</code>. Otherwise, <code>ResourceException</code> will be thrown at
	the initialization phrase.</p>
<p>The example below shows a sample model with this annotation.</p>
<div hljs language="java" include="'assets/code/docs/jsonApiToIncludeByDefault.java'"></div>


<h4 class="padding-top-1x heading-dash">JsonApiLookupIncludeAutomatically</h4>
<p>Field or getter annotated with <code>JsonApiLookupIncludeAutomatically</code> willl be automatically populated by
	Katharsis on <code>GET</code> requests. It can be added to every relationship defined by
	<code>JsonApiToOne</code> or <code>JsonApiToMany</code>.</p>
<p>The example below shows a sample class which will always contain a relationship's resource.</p>
<div hljs language="java" include="'assets/code/docs/JsonApiLookupIncludeAutomatically.java'"></div>


<p>The framework support fields inheritance, it is possible to define fields in superclasses.</p>
