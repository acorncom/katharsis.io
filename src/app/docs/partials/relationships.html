<p>One of the main features of JSON API and Katharsis is support of managing relations between resources. To achieve
	that, two steps are required:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add a field annotated with <code>JsonApiToOne</code> or <code>JsonApiToMany</code> (depending on multiplicity of
		the relation) which will represent a unidirectional relation.
	</li>
	<li>Add a relationship repository which implements <code>RelationshipRepository</code> interface.</li>
</ol>
